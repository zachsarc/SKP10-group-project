# Description
This application encrypts an input with different Caesar ciphers.

## Overview
The application encrypts a string input by the user with the selected cipher and then returns the output in a separate textbox. The application will default to the popular cipher rot13.

## Functions
### Read user input 
This turns whatever the user inputs into a text field into a string. 

### Select a cipher
This allows users to select from an assortment of Caeser Ciphers (rot1-25) in drop down menu and apply that cipher to their input.

### Apply cipher
This makes it so the cipher the user chose is applied to their string input.

### Return encrypted output
This returns the encrypted output into a text field for the user to copy and paste.

## Design
### User input
The text field for user input will be in large labelled box above the cipher selector. This will make it easy to read long inputs (like a copypasta). This field will use black text on a white background for ease of visibility.

### Encrypted output
The text field for encrypted output will be equally large to the user input box but placed under the cipher selector. This field will use black text on a white background for ease of visibility.

### Cipher Selector
The drop down box to select ciphers will be in between the user input and encrypted output fields and will be a small size just big enough to fit the longest cipher name.
