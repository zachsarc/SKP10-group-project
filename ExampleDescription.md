# Description


This application makes a shared TODO list.


## Overview


The ToDo list allows multiple users in different locations to access and manage a simple list of tasks.


## Functions


### Add to the ToDo list


This allows the ToDo list to be populated. Each item should have a free text field to describe the item, a text field to indicate the owner of the teask, and a time-date file for when the item is to be done (the deadline). The task owner may be entered blank.


### Take ownership of the item


This allows someone to take ownership of an item in the ToDo list.


### Mark and item as DONE


This allows the owner of the item to mark it as DONE.


## Design

### New items


New items are shown in green text.


### Done items


Done items are shown in grey, struck-out text.


### Owned items


If the current user is the owner of the item, then this item is shown in bold yellow.


### Errors


Errors are the only things that use the color red.
